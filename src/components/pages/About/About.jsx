                    The institute is committed to the challenging task of
                    development of technical education by preparing seasoned
                    graduates in highly sophisticated field of engineering and
                    technology. Development of India as an emerging industrial
                    power is a demanding exercise as it involves the combination
                    of cost effectiveness and efficiency along with producing
                    world-class technology at the cutting edge.The Institute,
                    located in Raipur, the Capital City of Chhattisgarh State,
                    is spared over an area of 100 acres. Raipur city is well
                    connected with Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, Visakhapatnam, Nagpur
                    & Bhubneshwar by regular flights and is on the main
                    Howrah-Mumbai railway line route. The institute is 5 km from
                    Raipur railway station and 14 km from airport on NH-6, the
                    Great Eastern Road.

                  excellence and several strengths, the institute has been
                  declared as National Institute of Technology (NIT) by the
                  Central Government on 1st Dec. 2005.
